# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property characteristics.

The model uses **Linear Regression**, one of the most fundamental supervised learning algorithms for regression tasks.
