This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify Iris flowers into three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Features
- Data preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Model training (KNN)
- Model evaluation
- Save trained model

## Accuracy
Achieves ~95–100% accuracy on test data.
